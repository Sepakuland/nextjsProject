<p>In the previous lectures, you saw a lot of usage of the <code>"use server"</code> directive.</p><p>What's very important to understand about this directive is the following:&nbsp;It's just "telling"&nbsp;NextJS that something should become a server action. I.e., that NextJS should send requests to that function behind the scenes (kind of).</p><p><code>"use server"</code> does <strong>not mean or guarantee that the code will only execute on the server!</strong>&nbsp;Whilst that will be the case for server actions, you can't rely on the usage of <code>"use server"</code> to <em>"hide code"</em>&nbsp;from the client!</p><p>If you have code that must never end up on the client-side (no matter if it's a server action or not), you should instead use the <code>server-only</code> package as described <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/composition-patterns#keeping-server-only-code-out-of-the-client-environment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
