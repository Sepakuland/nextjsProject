<p>In the <strong>next two lectures</strong>, we'll fine-tune ReactMarkdown to <strong>overwrite some default HTML&nbsp;elements</strong> it renders.</p><p>Unfortunately, since I recorded these lectures, <strong>ReactMarkdown received a major update</strong> and the shown <strong>syntax changed slightly</strong> <em>(i.e. what will be shown in the next two lectures has to change)</em>.</p><p>But thankfully, only <strong>minor adjustments</strong> are needed.</p><p>This link here shows the <strong>differences</strong> between all the code we'll write in the next lectures and adjustments that will be needed for React Markdown v6:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mschwarzmueller/nextjs-course-code/compare/3b99cd0...a9fb64b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/mschwarzmueller/nextjs-course-code/compare/3b99cd0...a9fb64b</a></p><p>So when we write code that is marked as "red"&nbsp;in the linked document, you should <strong>switch to the "green"&nbsp;version</strong> instead (when using ReactMarkdown v6 - check your package.json file to find out which version you're using).</p>
