<p>In this course, we always close our MongoDB connections via <code>client.close()</code>.</p><p>This works and you can do that.</p><p>If you build an application where your MongoDB-related code will execute <strong>frequently</strong> (e.g. the API&nbsp;route will be hit frequently), you might want to take advantage of MongoDB's "<strong>connection pooling</strong>"&nbsp;though.</p><p>For this, simply remove all <code>client.close()</code> calls from your code. The connection will then NOT&nbsp;be closed and will be re-used across requests.</p>
